An ongoing Android and iOS application to help 3D printing businesses keep track of their inventory.
Makers will be able to add their materials as well as create items they currently sell made from their materials.
Each product has a material length requirement and will be used to calculate when inventory is low.
This will take out a usually stressful and resource intense process for new and experienced sellers.
Currently uses Sqflite for permanent device storage.

Goals remaining:

Implement an OctoPi plugin to communicate with one or multiple printers

Integrate Etsy API for sales report on each item entered
